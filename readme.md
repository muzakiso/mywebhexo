# Personal Navigation Website

This is a personal navigation website based on Hexo. I modified the hexo core webstack to create a personal website.

I chose hexo because of its simplicity and ease of use. It's a static site generator based on node.js, which makes it easy to deploy and maintain.

I integrated some plugins and modified some configuration files to make this website more personalized. The main features of this website are:

* Responsive design.
* Support for tags and categories.
* A clean and simple layout.
* Syntax highlighting for code snippets.
* A blog section that shows my technical blogs.
* It can be easily customized with custom CSS and JavaScript.


I hope you will like it. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.
